# About this project

This project aims to provide an advanced development environment for AutoHotkey. I plan to design the system so that it is not strongly dependent on a particular editor, as it is intended to be developed for more than 10 years.

I will not accept Pull Requests as I will be programming for personal fun. (I could not find an option to disable Pull Requests). Instead, feature requests and bug reports will be accepted from [Issues](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/vscode-autohotkey/issues). If there is no trouble, I will be able to reply by the next day.

First, I aim to set small goals and repeat releases each time.
