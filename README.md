# Overview

This project is intended to solve a personal problem as well as to create an integrated development environment for AutoHotkey. It will be designed to be strongly independent of any particular editor and is intended to be developed over a period of 10 years or more.

Pull Request cannot be accepted due to personal reasons. Instead, I will accept feature requests, bug reports, etc. in [Issues](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/autohotkey-devtools/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/autohotkey-devtools/discussions).
