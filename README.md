# Overview

This project is intended to solve a personal problem as well as to create an integrated development environment for AutoHotkey. It will be designed to be strongly independent of any particular editor and is intended to be developed over a period of 10 years or more.

Pull Request cannot be accepted due to personal reasons. Instead, I will accept feature requests, bug reports, etc. in [Issues](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/autohotkey-devtools/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/autohotkey-devtools/discussions).

# License

**This project is not open source. It is a very non-permissive license that prohibits third parties from using the source code and claims all possible rights. Although it is open to the public for transparency, its nature is similar to closed source. However, an exception is made for those items that are separately permitted under GitHub's terms and conditions. This exception only applies while it is publicly available on GitHub.**

**Provided tools will be released in the form of extensions, plug-ins, etc., which will be only by end users at their own risk. By end users here, this means users who download or install the tools from official places that I have directly uploaded, and use them on their devices. In other words, only personal use is intended, and redistribution of the tools, etc. is prohibited.**

**This license is intended to protect my long plan that spans over 10 years. Therefore, please assume that all uses other than those contemplated will be denied. However, it is not intended to restrict end users any more than necessary, so if you have any requests, please discuss them in [Discussions](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/autohotkey-devtools/discussions). However, not everything will be allowed. Please understand in advance that this may cause inconvenience to end users.**

> **Note: Specific notes will be added as needed. There is basically no impact on the end user unless major problems arise.**

### Supplement

This project's first priority is to solve a personal problem. It is intentionally being developed by one person, as this is not a project that solves only universal problems. Therefore, I do not intend to collaborate with third parties, with the exception of feedback from end users.
